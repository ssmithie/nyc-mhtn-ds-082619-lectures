## Module 6 Projects

## Deep Learning and Advanced Topics

In module 6, we covered unsupervised learning, NLP, time series, recommender systems and deep learning. We'll have a presentation in class where you will be presenting to your fellow Data Scientists!

Your project must be focused on one of the following topics:


* Time Series
* Natural Language Processing
* Recommendation Systems
* Clustering
* Deep Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Mod 6 Project Specifications

Your project should contain:

* Problem Statement
  * A description of the problem at hand. What problem are you trying to solve? Why is it a problem?
* Evaluation metrics of your models and an explanation of which model is best for your given domain
* A description/visual representation of your data preparation and modeling pipeline
* At least 3 visualizations
* Conclusion
  * So what? Given your analysis, what do we now know about our initial problem statement?

Your final product can either be an analysis (in a Jupyter notebook, dashboard, or slideshow) or a web application (with Flask or Dash).

#### Data Gathering

Data can be captured from current databases online or scraped or be an extension of your module 5 project using data you've already obtained. If performing a classification, you should have at least 1000 observations belonging to each class.

Some useful sources of data for Deep Learning are:
