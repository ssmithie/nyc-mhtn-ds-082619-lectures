    "## Writing SQL Queries:\n",
    "    \n",
    "SQL syntax is fairly simple to follow, but writing SQL queries can be difficult because of all the logic and relationships you must mentally track. In order to make this a little more simple, we want to break this down into a three step process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pose a question.\n",
    "2. Determine what data is needed to answer the question, identify the table(s) where that data exists, and understand the relationship between the tables. \n",
    "3. Map all of this to SQL syntax."

    "## Syntax rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT lastName,firstName FROM Member WHERE state=”CA” AND\n",
    "city=”Fresno” ORDER BY lastName`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Capitalization**: The case of the SQL words doesn’t matter; for example, select is the same as SELECT, and from is the same as FROM, as far as MySQL is concerned. On the other hand, the case of the table names, column names, and other variable information does matter if your operating system is Unix or Linux. When you’re using Unix or Linux, MySQL needs to match the column names exactly, so the case for the column names has to be correct — for example, lastname isn’t the same as lastName. Windows, however, isn’t as picky as Unix and Linux; from its point of view, lastname and lastNameare the same.\n",
    "- **Spacing**: SQL words must be separated by one or more spaces. It doesn’t matter how many spaces you use; you could just as well use 20 spaces or just 1 space. SQL also doesn’t pay any attention to the end of the line. You can start a new line at any point in the SQL statement or write the entire statement on one line.\n",
    "- **Quotes**: Notice that CA and Fresno are enclosed in double quotes (“) in the preceding query. CA and Fresno are a series of characters called text strings or character strings. You’re asking MySQL to compare the text strings in the SQL query with the text strings already stored in the database. When you compare numbers (such as integers) stored in numeric columns, you don’t enclose the numbers in quotes.\n",
